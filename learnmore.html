        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>As an experienced developer, I am excited to bring my skills to application development. I have a strong
            background in designing and developing software applications, conducting unit tests, and maintaining code
            quality. With my proficiency in independent coding and creative problem-solving, I'm confident in my ability
            to lead a team and translate system requirements into the design and development of customized systems in an
            agile environment.</p>

        <h2>(Private)Specialized Solutions in Mathematic, Finance, Low-level programming, involving Unix based OS</h2>
        <p>This includes some projects based on my needs. Most of these are math libraries that I believe should have
            already existed, created exclusively for math and astronomy enthusiasts. For quantitative trading it
            includes investment tools
            that rely on Stock Exchange APIs. These tools are available in both MySQL and PostgreSQL databases and have
            a web
            interface. I've got some Linux projects too, and I might make them public soon under a GNU/GPLv3 license.
