        <h2>(Private)Specialized Solutions in Mathematic, Finance, Low-level programming, involving Unix based OS</h2>
        <p>This includes some projects based on my needs. Most of these are math libraries that I believe should have
            already existed, created exclusively for math and astronomy enthusiasts. For quantitative trading it includes investment tools
            that rely on Stock Exchange APIs. These tools are available in both MySQL and PostgreSQL databases and have a web
            interface. I've got some Linux projects too, and I might make them public soon under a GNU/GPLv3 license.
